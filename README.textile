h2. Collection of Vim Plugins

I primary use Vim for web development with ruby and rails. So the following
plugins are included:

* rails.vim
* cucumber
* haml
* jslint
* matchit
* snipmate
* serveral git related ones
* latex
* ... and many more, look at +vendor/+

h2. Installation

@code@
   mv ~/.vim ~/.vim-b4-niklas
   mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc-b4-niklas

   git clone git://github.com/niklas/dotvim.git ~/.vim
   ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
   vim ~/.vim/rc/local.vim # put your stuff here

h2. Modularity

The vimrc is split up in serveral files to accomplish a kind of organization ..
we will see where this will lead us.

You can modify +rc/local.vim+ to your needs. It will be sourced as last file
from the +rc/+ dir and will never be overwritten by the repository.


h2. Collaboration

Please fork and send me a pull request if you have something awesome :)

h2. Thanks
